## 🃏 Rules of the game:
The game is played with an Italian card deck (40 cards: Clubs, Swords, Dinars, Cups).
The object of Solitaire is to move all the cards on the bases, one for each suit, in ascending order, starting with the Ace and ending with the King.
The cards on the right-hand side of the screen are arranged in columns, each of which has a pile of cards corresponding to its position.
It will be necessary to move the last card of the deck that will be visible in the bases or columns so that the previous card is of a different suit and of a higher value.
If one of the columns is empty, you can place any card or ladder (in descending order).
